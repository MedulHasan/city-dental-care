They require a minimum of reduction of the natural tooth, (-generally not more than .5mm), they don’t change color, have a life span of 15-20 years, and the entire process can be completed in two visits. They are an excellent solution to problems such as tetracycline stains and translucency factors, which simple tooth whitening procedures can not correct. They can often correct problems of tooth alignment that otherwise would be corrected by braces.",
